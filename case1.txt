Patient Mr. Carlos Castillo, 30 years old, says it has been five weeks since he starts to sneeze in the nights. After checking his noise, we can see a little nasal polyps in the right hole; also we have noticed that the noise is irritated. The patient states he has stuffy nose daily lately and also he has noticed a loss of sense of smell. We believe that he has developed an allergy and asthma.
