# SematicWeb
Project: Using ontologies to retrieve evidences from clinical notes.

The goal: this is the first step in the creation of an ontology-based information retrieval system. Currently there are a lot of unstructured information scattered in the Internet, by applying ontologies and semantic web tools its possible to index, store and retrieve heterogeneous information, and deliver the right information to the users according to their specific need. 

This is the source code of the project. It is based on two ontologies, one is for adult asthma and the other is the structure of two evidence databases.
It has two classes and a MySQL database, this is the order to call them.
(1)RDFModel.java
(2)Match.java

Also we provide a capture knowledge ontology in this case the domain is adult asthma (asthma.owl), and the second is a knowledge ontology repository (evidence.owl).
