Project: Using ontologies to retrieve evidences from clinical notes.

This is the source code of the project. It is based on two ontologies, one is for adult asthma and the other is the structure of two evidence databases.
It has two classes and a MySQL database, this is the order to call them.
(1)RDFModel.java
(2)Match.java

Also we provide a capture knowledge ontology in this case the domain is adult asthma (asthma.owl), and the second is a knowledge ontology repository (evidence.owl).

The next step for this project: the creation of a fully interoperability multi-language ontology-based (concept-based) information retrieval system. Currently there are a lot of unstructured information scattered on the Internet, by applying ontologies and semantic web tools its possible to index, store and retrieve heterogeneous information, and deliver the right information to the users according to their specific need.
